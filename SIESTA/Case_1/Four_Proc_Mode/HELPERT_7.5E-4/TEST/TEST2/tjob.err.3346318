Please note that in the future you will need to specify an explicit version
also when loading the 'anaconda' module, just as is already required for the
compiler and MPI modules. In case you need to load the anaconda module for your
jobs, please adapt your submit scripts already now. Use

  module load anaconda/3/2021.11

to load version 3/2021.11 explicitly, for example.
