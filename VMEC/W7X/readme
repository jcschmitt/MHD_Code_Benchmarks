These files should be sufficient to run Free Boundary VMEC files for specific W7-X cases.

Coils:  This folder contains a coils definition for the W7-X coil set, and two set of makegrid/mgrid/xgrid commands. One set of commands will generate an mgrid (and related files) the are appropriate for VMEC evaluations. The other set of commands generates an mgrid file that is slightly larger and is intended to be appropriate for free-boundary SIESTA calculations.


EIM_Configuration/NS_401_APHI_v1  This folder contains a zero-pressure, zero-current free-boundary VMEC input file. The LCFS of the solutions 'just touches' the divertor structure in W7-X. The input file is set up to use an optimized APHI array and 401 surfaces. This is for the 'so-called-standard' EIM configuration.  The extcur coil current array includes 'correction currents' that account for changes in the rotational transform due to E-M forces on the field coils. 

FOM003_Configuration: This folder constains two free-boundary VMEC input files for the FOM003 configuration. One file is for a 'low-resolution', NS=51, MPOL=8,NTOR=8 solution.  The other is for a 'high-resolution',  NS=401, MPOL=12, NTOR=12, with a modified APHI array.
